Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Marketing at Stern School of Business, New York University. I will be joining the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University as an Assistant Professor in Marketing in Fall 2024!

My research mainly focuses on digital platform applications, with an emphasis on understanding the interplay between platform design, user behaviors, and outcomes.
The research approach I employed is primarily empirical, including structural models, causal inference, field experiments, and machine learning techniques.
