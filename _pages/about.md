Welcome!

Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Marketing at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). 

As an empirical modeler, my research primarily focuses on two streams: understanding the two-sided market, and investigating how information impact consumersâ€™ beliefs and behaviors. 

To explore these topics, I employ a range of techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning, causal inference, and Bayesian estimation methods. 

Prior to HKUST, I earned an M.Sc from Simon Business School at University of Rochester while enrolled in the Ph.D. program. I received my B.S in Statictis from the University of Science and Technology of China.
