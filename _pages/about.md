Welcome!

I am an Assitant Professor in Marketing at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

My research mainly focuses on digital platform applications, with an emphasis on understanding the interplay between platform design, user behaviors, and outcomes.
The research approach I employ is primarily empirical, including structural models, causal inference, field experiments, and machine learning techniques.
